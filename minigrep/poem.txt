Soft golden sunlight on morning’s first breath,  
Whispers of hope in delicate hue—  
Petals unfold, defying the frost,  
Dancing with dreams as dawn breaks anew.  
River’s cool laughter along ancient stones,  
A song carried gently, melodious, kind—  
Nature’s embrace, a comforting truth,  
Carved by the passage of mercy and time.  
Breezes write verses on emerald leaves,  
Clouds paint their wishes across sapphire sky.  
Kindred hearts wander through forests of thought,  
Seeking the magic that tells them to fly.  
Love flickers silent—a lantern in night—  
Guiding the soul toward radiant light.
